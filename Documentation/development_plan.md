# Prototype Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for developing a prototype of the Jamaica Police Department Workforce Management System based on the requirements analysis, research, and system architecture design.

## Prototype Scope
The prototype will demonstrate key functionality of the system with a focus on:

1. User authentication and role-based access
2. Shift management and scheduling
3. Task assignment and tracking
4. Real-time geolocation tracking
5. Basic reporting and analytics

## Development Approach
We'll use a phased approach to build the prototype:

1. **Phase 1**: Setup development environment and project structure
2. **Phase 2**: Develop backend API services
3. **Phase 3**: Develop web frontend
4. **Phase 4**: Develop mobile application
5. **Phase 5**: Integrate components and implement real-time features

## Technology Stack for Prototype
For rapid development of the prototype, we'll use:

- **Frontend Web**: React.js with Material-UI
- **Mobile App**: React Native
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for prototype simplicity)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO
- **Maps/Geolocation**: Mapbox

## Development Tasks

### Phase 1: Setup
- Create project structure for backend, web frontend, and mobile app
- Set up MongoDB database
- Configure development environment
- Set up basic CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- Implement user authentication service
- Develop user management API
- Develop shift management API
- Develop task assignment API
- Implement geolocation tracking API
- Create reporting endpoints

### Phase 3: Web Frontend Development
- Create login and authentication screens
- Develop admin dashboard
- Implement shift management interface
- Build task assignment and tracking views
- Create personnel management screens
- Develop reporting and analytics views
- Implement real-time map view for personnel tracking

### Phase 4: Mobile App Development
- Create login and authentication screens
- Develop officer dashboard
- Implement shift viewing and management
- Build task acceptance and reporting
- Implement geolocation tracking
- Create incident reporting with photo upload

### Phase 5: Integration
- Integrate real-time communication
- Connect frontend applications with backend services
- Implement end-to-end testing
- Deploy prototype for demonstration

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1 day
- Phase 2: 3 days
- Phase 3: 3 days
- Phase 4: 3 days
- Phase 5: 2 days

Total: 12 days for prototype development

## Deliverables
1. Functional prototype demonstrating core features
2. Source code with documentation
3. Setup instructions
4. User guide for prototype testing
5. Implementation recommendations for production development
