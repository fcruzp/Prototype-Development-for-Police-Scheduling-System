# Jamaica Police Department Workforce Management System - Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for the Jamaica Police Department Workforce Management System prototype. The testing will cover all components of the system including the backend API, web frontend, and mobile application.

## Test Environments
1. **Backend**: Node.js/Express with MongoDB
2. **Web Frontend**: React with Material-UI
3. **Mobile App**: React Native

## Testing Approach

### 1. Unit Testing
- Test individual components and functions in isolation
- Verify that each unit of code performs as expected
- Focus on edge cases and error handling

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test interactions between different components
- Verify that data flows correctly between components
- Test API endpoints with various inputs

### 3. System Testing
- Test the complete system as a whole
- Verify that all requirements are met
- Test end-to-end workflows

### 4. User Acceptance Testing
- Test the system from the user's perspective
- Verify that the system meets the user's expectations
- Gather feedback for improvements
